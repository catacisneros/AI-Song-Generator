# AI Song Generator

This project is an AI-based song generator that creates music or song lyrics using machine learning models. You can use it to generate new lyrics or melodies based on existing data and prompts.

## Features

- **Lyrics Generation**: Generates song lyrics based on a user-provided prompt using GPT-2.
- **Melody Generation**: Creates melodies in MIDI format using recurrent neural networks (RNN) and models from the Magenta library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for development)
- MIDI music editor (if working with MIDI files)

### Libraries and Tools

You'll need the following Python libraries:

- `transformers` (for GPT-2 based lyrics generation)
- `torch` (PyTorch for deep learning)
- `tensorflow` (if using Magenta for melody generation)
- `magenta` (for music generation models)
- `music21` (for working with MIDI files)

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers torch tensorflow magenta music21
